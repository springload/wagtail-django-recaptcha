> Wagtail forms with a ReCaptcha form field/widget integration app.
> Wagtail ReCaptcha provides an easy way to integrate the [django-recaptcha](https://github.com/django-recaptcha/django-recaptcha) field when using the Wagtail formbuilder.

Check out [Awesome Wagtail](https://github.com/springload/awesome-wagtail) for more awesome packages and resources from the Wagtail community.

## Compatibility

- Django 5.2, 6.0
- Wagtail 7.0 LTS, 7.3, 7.4 LTS
- Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14

## Installation

1.  Install wagtailcaptcha via pip `pip install wagtail-django-recaptcha` or add `wagtailcaptcha` to your Python path.
2.  Add `wagtailcaptcha` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.
3.  Configure django-recaptcha as explained in the [django recaptcha documentation](https://github.com/django-recaptcha/django-recaptcha).

## Usage

### Field

The quickest way to add a captcha field to a Wagtail Form Page is to inherit from the two options provided, `WagtailCaptchaForm` or `WagtailCaptchaEmailForm`. The first options inherits from `AbstractForm` while the seconds does it from `AbstractEmailForm`. Either way your page is going to display a captcha field at the end of
the form.

Example

```python
from wagtail.contrib.forms.models import AbstractFormField
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel, InlinePanel, MultiFieldPanel
from wagtail.fields import RichTextField

from modelcluster.fields import ParentalKey

from wagtailcaptcha.models import WagtailCaptchaEmailForm


class SubmitFormField(AbstractFormField):
    page = ParentalKey('SubmitFormPage', related_name='form_fields')


class SubmitFormPage(WagtailCaptchaEmailForm):
    body = RichTextField(blank=True, help_text='Edit the content you want to see before the form.')
    thank_you_text = RichTextField(blank=True, help_text='Set the message users will see after submitting the form.')

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "Form submission page"


SubmitFormPage.content_panels = [
    FieldPanel('title', classname="full title"),
    FieldPanel('body', classname="full"),
    FieldPanel('thank_you_text', classname="full"),
    InlinePanel('form_fields', label="Form fields"),
    MultiFieldPanel([
        FieldPanel('to_address'),
        FieldPanel('from_address'),
        FieldPanel('subject'),
    ], "Email notification")
]
```

The captcha field can't be added from the admin UI but will appear in your frontend as the last of the form fields.

If you need to customise the behaviour of the form builder, make sure to inherit from `wagtailcaptcha.forms.WagtailCaptchaFormBuilder` instead of Wagtail's default form builder, then declare it as usual on the page model.

```python
from wagtailcaptcha.forms import WagtailCaptchaFormBuilder
from wagtailcaptcha.models import WagtailCaptchaForm


class CustomFormBuilder(WagtailCaptchaFormBuilder):
    # Some custom behaviour...


class FormPage(WagtailCaptchaForm):
    form_builder = CustomFormBuilder
    # The rest of the page definition as usual...
```

For a more thorough example, [Made with Wagtail](http://madewithwagtail.org/) ([github.com/springload/madewithwagtail](https://github.com/springload/madewithwagtail)) is an example of an open-source site using this module.
